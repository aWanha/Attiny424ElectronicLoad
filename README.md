# Attiny424ElectronicLoad
Attiny424 controlled dc load. Basic features such as constant current, resistance and power. Can measure battery energy and remove load when dut voltage drops below defined threshold level. Load can be set in 1mA increments within 2%, main cause of bad accuracy in given design is the cheap op amp. Interface through buttons and serial communication
